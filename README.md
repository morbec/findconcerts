# findyourconcerts

Find concerts of your favorite artists

## Description

This project was developed by [Jes√∫s](https://github.com/j-jmnz) and me. Our idea was to create a site with a minimalist approach yet funcional and elegant where users can search for events of their favorite artists with no hassle and no clutter.

We used the API's from [Bandsintown](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0) and [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development) plus [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Express-Session](https://github.com/expressjs/session), [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/), [bycript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

We deployed it on [Heroku](https://find-your-concerts.herokuapp.com/)
